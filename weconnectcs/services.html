                    <h3>Youth Program (Each One Reach One)</h3>
                    <p>Engaging youth from diverse communities in Mentorship, Skill Building Programs that will promote Youth Development, Empowerment and Philanthropy.</p>
                    <p>Our overall mission is to engage youth to build a volunteer base in the city of Vaughan. WEConnect plans to engage youth and seniors from Vaughan area and its neighbourhood and give them a platform to socially engage in activities
                        that will promote their development, empowerment and Philanthropy in these young residents while engaging seniors in active life, sharing their experiences and cultural heritage with youth. Program will link youth with seniors
                        who are either living with them or participants of our programs or senior residents in their neighbourhoods or senior care facilities.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to educate and make youth aware of needs of elderly people, to get engaged in the activities of daily life with them, learn new skills. To know what is elder abuse and neglect, and how youth can play a positive role in
                        the lives of seniors with whom they interact.</p>
                    <p>Our first step will be to approach school boards/ settlement counsellors and foster partnership with them. We will organise information sessions on related topics for students and encourage or invite them to participate in our "EACH
                        ONE REACH ONE"‐ program, invest time in their communities, work to help seniors/ diverse communities and gain volunteer experience. They will be able to complete their mandatory 40 hours of volunteer time as well they will learn
                        new skills. Arranging workshops on budgeting, time management, seniors care, senior’s health and safety, resources in the community etc. Fun and skill building programs could also be made available to students. These workshops
                        will be supported by partners with expertise in financial management, seniors health and care and life skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>By building a youth volunteer base and providing them with opportunities will help high school students complete their mandatory volunteer hours needed for graduation. The outcome of the engagement of youth with seniors is providing
                        an intergenerational exchange. This exchange will lighten spirits of the seniors, as well as help build new skills and intrinsic values in the youth who engage by showing them a broader perspective of life. This also helps build
                        responsibility, increase their self‐esteem and give students a stronger sense of belonging when they engage in their communities.</p>
                    <p>WEConnect will foster strong partnerships with school boards and school settlement and social workers in order to reach out to the students and their parents.</p>
