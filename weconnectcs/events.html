        <h2>Carassauga India Pavilion</h2>
        <p>The WEConnect Community Services India Pavilion of Carassauga is an annual three day festival at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga Ontario which showcases the cultural traditions, history, costumes and cuisines of India. This year’s Indian Pavilion will take visitors on a journey filled with sights, sounds, tastes and aromas as they travel through the North, East, South and West parts of majestic India. Visitors will walk through a gallery display of ancient Indian artwork into an outdoor themed twilight lit pavilion. Overlooking the Indian Pavilion will be an enchanting lifelike backdrop of the Taj Mahal. The Indian Pavilion will be a platform for artistic dance performances, handmade craft workshops, kids interactive learning zones, cooking classes and spirituality huts all representing different parts of India. Restaurants will be interwoven throughout the pavilion each serving different varieties of Indian cuisine. WEConnect Community Services is known to develop and facilitate events that are culturally specific and connect the multicultural communities in Canada and abroad. Events such as Culture days, Bollywood Movie Night, International Women's Day (month long events) and celebrating Indian Independence Day with Municipal flag raising are to name a few where WEConnect acts as a bridge to connect communities. With a foot traffic of over 350,000, the India Pavilion of Carassauga will educate, attract, and engage visitors and bring awareness of future WEConnect Events. Our Celebrating Ontario 2016 Enhancement Project aims not only to invite visitors to attend the 3 day India Pavilion but to increase repeat tourist visitations and overnight stays to Ontario for future and larger WEConnect Community Services events.
